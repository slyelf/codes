								My goal is to play Skyrim in a roleplay manner. I plan to play the Main Questline, the Dragonborn DLC, the Dawnguard DLC as well as the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood later when my character goes a bit more insane later down the track. I would like my character to start of as a 'good' guy but then later become more insane as he/she goes through various experiences. Through the use of various mods I would like to be able to survive using the hardcore preset of frostfall, hunterborn and realistic needs and diseases. Using mods that add guilds I can also become a bard which I could use a let go to the all the insanity and become more normal after the accidents. Other guilds would be the hunting guild just to name a few. I would like to start off as an outcast and slowly work my way up to become a noble. I would also like to play as a werewolf and later turn into a werewolf but if I get turned into vampire before this then I will stay as a vampire until a cure is made.<br>

											<a class="expand" onclick='help_click(help1, "<span id=paragraph><p><b><u><span id=r1>History</span></u></b><br>Recorded Tamrielic history was divided into four distinct eras: the First Era, the Second Era, the Third Era, and the Fourth Era. There was one other era that occurred before the beginning of recorded time. This was the Dawn Era, during which the universe and everything in it came into being.<br><br><b><u><span class=r2>First Era</span></u></b><br>The long First Era is mostly marked by the shifting of power from Elves to Men and the birth of some of the most powerful religions in the land. From the heartland of Tamriel, we learn of the struggling Human race: from their miserable fate as slaves to finally being able to push out their Elven masters from the land. From the northeast part of the continent, the Heart of Lorkhan tempts so many mortals, from the Dwemer to Chimer. The Divine Heart causes a terrible war, and the extinction of a once great race, the Dwemer.<br><br><b><u><span class=r2>Second Era</span></u></b><br>The Second Era starts after the Akaviri Potentate Versidue Shaie assassinates the last of the Cyrodiil line. This is also the era when some of the most powerful factions in Tamriel are born, the Mages Guild and the Dark Brotherhood being two from among the greatest to arise during this time period. In 2E 583, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal launched an invasion of Tamriel, in an attempt to pull Tamriel into his realm of Coldharbour. Molag Bal was doing this by using devices known as Dark Anchors. The era finally ends after Tiber Septim, wielding a Dwemer artifact called Numidium, successfully unites the entire Tamrielic landmass once again.<br><br><b><u><span class=r2>Third Era</span></u></b><br>The Third Era, which some describe as the most glorious era thus far, is the time of the Septim Dynasty. In fact, the long line of Septim Emperors almost reaches an end at several points in the history of this period. Some of the significant events are the War of the Red Diamond, a civil war over the succession, and a long decade of reign by the traitorous Jagar Tharn. Furthermore, this era is marked by the rebirth of Nerevar Indoril, the greatest Chimeri general; as well as the rebirth of Numidium and the second Dragon Break that follows. The Oblivion Crisis also arose when the Daedric Prince, Mehrunes Dagon, attempted to enter the mortal world in his god-like state. In the final days of the Third Era, the emperor, Uriel Septim VII is assassinated at the beginning of the next chapter in the Elder Scrolls, Oblivion, along with all his heirs, save one illegitimate son, Martin Septim. In the final fight for Septims life, the Blades were aided by an escaped prisoner. It was this escaped prisoner who rescued Martin from the siege of Kvatch, this prisoner who again and again stormed Oblivion, and this prisoner who recovered the Amulet of Kings. It was also this prisoner, called Champion of Cyrodiil, Hero of Kvatch, and Savior of Bruma, who witnessed Martins ultimate self-sacrifice to end the Oblivion Crisis, and with it, the Third Era.<br><br><b><u><span class=r2>Fourth Era</span></u></b><br>At the beginning of this era was the fall of the Mages Guild.<br><br>On 4E 22, the Thalmor and the Third Aldmeri Dominion recovered and resurrected its old power in the Summerset Isles. In 4E 29, the Third Aldmeri Dominion invaded Valenwood, overthrew the government and allied themselves with the Bosmer there. In 4E 98, the two moons, Masser and Secunda, mysteriously disappeared. After two years, the two moons finally returned. There was confusion and fear throughout the Empire, but in Elsweyr, it was much worse. This was because the moons were very important to the Khajiit (who were natives of Elsweyr) and their culture. The Thalmor immediately announced that they had restored the moons using previously unknown Dawn magicks, so the Khajiit credited the Thalmor as their saviors. The Third Aldmeri Dominion was now composed of the Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr. This alliance was growing in size, power and ambition, while the Empire was collapsing.<br><br><b><u><span class=r3>Second Century</span></u></b><br>On the 30th of Frostfall, in 4E 171, the Aldmeri Dominion sent one of their ambassadors to the Imperial City with a gift in a covered cart and an ultimatum for the Emperor. The list of demands included tributes, disbandment of the Blades, outlawing the worship of Talos and the ceding of large sections of Hammerfell to the Dominion. The Emperor rejected the ultimatum, and the Thalmor ambassador upended the cart, spilling over a hundred heads on the floor of every Blades agent in the Summerset Isles and Valenwood. With this meeting, the Great War was about to begin.<br><br>The Dominion then launched a full-scale invasion of Hammerfell and Cyrodiil. The Dominions initial objective was to take control of Hammerfell. Most of the Dominions armies invaded Hammerfell, which included Lady Arannelya and her forces, who moved into Western Cyrodiil from Valenwood, bypassing Anvil and Kvatch and crossing into Hammerfell. At the same time, Lord Naarifin led his forces into Cyrodiil from the south. Then, over the next two years, the Aldmeri Dominion changed its primary military objective from taking over Hammerfell to take over the Imperial City, the rest of Cyrodiil and the overthrow of the Empire. This was due to the surprising success of Lord Naarifin and his forces in Cyrodiil. In 4E 172, the Cyrodilic cities of Bravil and Anvil both fell to Dominion forces. Naval battles were fought in Lake Rumare and along the Niben. In Hammerfell, Dominion forces consolidated their gains as they continued to advance deeper into the province. The only city that held out was Hegathe. In 4E 174, the Dominions military leadership committed all available forces and resources to the invasion of Cyrodiil. On the 12 of Second Seed, they launched a full-scale invasion of the Imperial City. The walls were breached, and the Dominion forces entered the city. The Imperial Palace was burned, the White Gold Tower (Structure) looted, with the innocent populace being affected as well.<br><br>Eventually, the fighting became too much to bear for the Empire. With the sack of the Imperial City and the Battle of the Red Ring, the war nearly destroyed the Empire until Titus Mede II and the Empire were forced to sign the White-Gold Concordant in late 4E 175.<br><br></p></span>")'><b>READ MORE</b></a></button>
