								Great role-playing begins with a great character. I always try to come up with a basic story for my character before starting a new game. It doesn't have to be anything complex, just three or four key points that help define how your character is going to relate to the world.
									<br><br>
								Most people have some idea of the race and class skills they want to explore, but this is really only half the battle, and one of the reasons why people so often find themselves restarting characters. You need to think beyond race, class, and gender. You need to go beyond what color your character's eyes are, how she wears her hair, and whether or not she has war paint. These are superficial details, and while they are important, and form a part of every great character, they are not the details that are going to make for a great role-playing experience. They can inspire a great character, but won't do all the work all on their own.

											<a class="expand" onclick='help_click(help1, "<span id=paragraph><p><span class=r2><b>10 RULES TO A BETTER ROLE-PLAYING EXPERIENCE:</b></span><br>There are 10 rules in order to have a better role-playing experience in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. These rules are to Plan your Character, Play in Character, Avoid the Min/Maxing Mindset, Walk Everywhere, Change the Timescale, Eat, Sleep and Get Married, Use Reasonable Rules for Encumberance and Gear, Use the Wait Function, Choose a Difficulty Setting that Suits your Character and Reduce Screen Clutter. If any number of these 10 rules are followed a better role-playing experience can be made.<br><br><span class=r2><b>JOBS THAT YOU CAN PLAY:</b><br></span>There are many different jobs that you can use to play and role-play a very well thought out and structured game. All of these jobs are of course optional and can be swapped between. These jobs or roles are: Chef, Lumberjack, Blacksmith, Fletcher, Merchant, Farmer, Miner, Courier, Town Guard, Librarian or Hunter. These all are just some examples and can be used to incorporate into your characters backstory or into the gameplay.<br><br><span class=r2><b>CHALLENGES:</b><br></span>To create more of a challenge, these are various challenges that can be followed. These challenges include: Realism mode. This mode includes turning off the hud, using only the paper map, no waiting, eat regularly and wash clothes etc. Other modes include researcher, ze gourmet, hardcore mode, whispering fang, the lone wolf, giant hunter, nomad, hunter and gatherer, psychopath, homeless scrounger, college student, paladin, rogue cop, scavanger, morality, dragonborn, no crafting etc.<br><br><span class=r2><b>ROLE-PLAYING GUIDE: LYNCATHROPY (WEREWOLF)</b><br></span>To role play as a werewolf multiple things should be kept in mind. These include think like the beast, transformation and personality. Many people seem to forget when roleplaying werewolves is that you are transforming into a beast. A beast does not think. A beast is not a tactician. A beast goes by primal instinct - Attack, eat, flee. Werewolf nature is feral. Spare no one. Suffer the emotional pain. This will depth to your characters story. <br><br>Always transform under the full moon to hunt. Sometimes you will get random urges to transform, my evidence for this is Sinding. He mauled the little girl because she seemed easy prey - weak, defenseless. Consider wearing the Cursed Ring of Hircine. I heavily suggest PC gamers to install Moonlight Tales as this gives you unwanted transformations depending on the moon cycle as some other cool features including customisation for your beast form.<br><br>This is mainly down to the roleplayer so I am just going to throw a few ideas your way:Depression - As mentioned earlier if your werewolf kills a loved one or close friend, they may get depressed and maybe turn to drink or skooma, possible even suicidal thoughts. But this could also lead to determination to find a cure.Schizophrenia / Madness -  Werewolves slowly lose their human nature over time. Your werewolf could be plagued with nightmares of him killing innocent people. Your werewolf will eventually lose his sanity and turn feral.<br><br><span class=r2><b>ROLE-PLAYING GUIDE: THIEF</b><br></span>The thief is a stealthy and sneaky person who is all about making a profit through others wealth. To role play as a thief you should remember to rob over kill, dont loot bodies, dont be too impulsive, dont carry too much and wear a disguise in public.<br><br><span class=r3><b><u>Rule #1: Robbing Over Killing</u></b></span><br>What separates a thief and an assassin is their objective--the thief wants money, the assassin wants death. Does it really make sense for a professional thief to kill everyone in every location he comes across and loot the place afterward? Not only is this a waste of all the skills you have spent your life honing, but it would realistically draw a lot of attention to you, which is never good for someone of your profession. Do not limit your thievery to quests. Instead, have larceny on your mind at all times. You can decide how your character feels about killing--he/she could have a strong aversion to it, or a casual disregard for it, but either way, remember your objective is not to wipe out everyone in a given location, it is to walk away with all the loot. This can help you discover a whole new approach to dungeons and forts, and encourage more strategy. It can actually be much more challenging to steal without or with less killing, because we all know stealth characters kill pretty easily.<br><br><span class=r3><b><u>Rule #2: Do not Loot Bodies (Usually)</u></b></span><br>You are a professional thief, a master of your craft. You are wealthy, respected, and for those unfortunate enough to know your true identity, feared. Does it really make sense for you to strip search every dead body to find some hide bracers and a few septims? Have some class. This might seem counter-intuitive, as a thief does not make a habit of passing up coin, but we are talking about a real thief here, not some petty scavenger. What separates the thief from the common bandit is that they usually set out to steal something specific. Obviously you usually ca not do this unless you are on a quest, but you can still incorporate this mentality by only looting chests, or otherwise things that would likely hold valuables worth stealing.<br><br><span class=r3><b><u>Rule #3: Do not be too Impulsive</u></b></span><br>No one ever became a master thief by grabbing everything he found shiny--always steal with a battle plan. This mainly applies to thievery in cities, where anonymity is a must. Say you walk into a shop and notice some very enticing merchandise. Do not just crouch in the corner until your detection meter goes to hidden, or grab all the ingredients when the alchemist turns their back, or, god forbid, put a bucket over someones head and rob them blind.<br><br><span class=r3><b><u>Rule #4: Do not Carry too Much</u></b></span><br>It breaks immersion quite a bit to be carrying around ten suits of armor in your ass. Instead, designate a handful of items that are “equipped.” (I highly recommend the equipping overhaul if you have access to it.) This is one set of armor, and a few weapons that you use regularly. Now, instead of using the vanilla carry weight system, pretend your carry weight is half of your max stamina. This means you will have fifty carry weight at the start of the game. However, do not include your designated set of “equipped” items in this carry weight. The carry weight is meant to simulate your backpack, or loot sack, or whatever you want to call it. It makes sense that these would not be in your pack. If you get the extra pockets perk, pretend it gives you 25 instead of 100 extra carry weight.<br><br><span class=r3><b><u>Rule #5: Wear a Disguise in Public</u></b></span><br>This one is pretty self-explanatory--it is a simple little habit that immerses you a ton. Anonymity is key for a thief, and wearing your Thieves Guild armor in cities does not make a whole lot of sense. Even if you are wearing modded armor, or you think Thieves Guild armor is not directly associated with the guild in any way, you will still look like a shady character, and you want to look as much like one of the common folk as possible. Any non-armor, non-mage robe apparel works, really. I recommend wearing simple, cheap clothes at first, and once you make a name for yourself and have a good chunk of change to it, start wearing fine clothes and gold diamond jewelry. This way, you will be working your way up the ladder both behind the scenes, and in front of them.</p>")'><b>READ MORE</b></a></button>
