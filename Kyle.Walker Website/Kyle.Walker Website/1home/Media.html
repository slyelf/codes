											<a class="expand" onclick='help_click(help1, "<p><b><u>Background</u></b><br>The background of a character is arguably the most important part of any roleplay. This determines how they view the world due to circumstances in their past lives, and is what helps one begin their story on a definitive path that is able to twist and turn depending on how their view changes over time. No roleplay character starts off with a blank slate as if no background is created the character is lifeless, the background is essentially the soul of any roleplay. For example my Summerset Isle Orc would likely have been raised in horribly poor conditions and mistreated by the Altmer of the area, this can lead to different paths ranging from absolute hatred of elves or can lead to a fear of all things elven.<br><br><b><u>Motivation</u></b><br>Motivation is what drives your character to accomplish things throughout their lives. What do they want to do when they get somewhere? Why would they try to steal that sweetroll from the Jarl? Why would they spend their time traveling to Morthal when they have everything they need in Riften? These questions are important for each character to accomplish tasks and strive. For example I would have to ask why my Orc left the Summerset Isle and went to Skyrim. Would it be because she strives for a better life, or she heard that Skyrim hates the elves and went there to finally find more peace than she had?<br><br><b><u>Personality</u></b><br>A characters personality encompasses many things, strengths and weaknesses, habits and quirks, hobbies, etc. These are what spice up your character, give them more human qualities, and allow you to connect with your character a bit more. What is your character afraid of, what are they good at, what are they bad at, what do they do when they arent trying to get themselves killed by fighting dragons? My Orc for example enjoys food tasting and cooking, as when she was younger she was unable to eat as the others could therefore she tends to hoard food and then gorge herself until she cant move. Her fear of elves means that she avoids them at all costs, and has a mistrust of magic users in general.<br><br><b><u>Appearance</u></b><br>Appearance is a thing to consider when creating your character. Their scars, complexion, and body mass tell a story. No noble will be extremely thin and have a sunburned and dirty face likewise no farmer would be clean and pale as they would be working out on the farm. Where did that scar come from, why is the dirt this color, do they laugh a lot, or are they serious? Appearance also tells the general age of a character no old man is going to look like they have had Botox. The Orc for example would have a dirtier, and darker complexion, as likely she spent most of her time outside learning how to work. Likewise she would probably have callouses and scars from working wherever she could whether that be on a farm or in the mines.<br><br><b><u>Player-Environment Interaction</u></b><br>This defines how you would act vs. how your character would act, your character is not you it is their own person. How they react is different than how you would act; the goal here is to put yourself in the mindset of a character, likewise you do not want to put your character in your mindset else it wouldnt be roleplaying just living your life vicariously through the character. Think of a few situations in how you would act, then compare it to your character is it similar or different. I am not saying not to make your character take the same choice, but the reasons would be different as they are a different person. The Orc would not even talk to an elf if they could help it, while I as the player know that they are a good person and can help me. The key to this is to find the right balance between your character, the world, and you.</p>")'><b>READ MORE</b></a></button>
