			<p>A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.
			
			The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld computing devices. Specialized video games such as arcade games, in which the video game components are housed in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, while common in the 1980s in video arcades, have gradually declined due to the widespread availability of affordable home video game consoles (e.g., PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Wii U) and video games on desktop and laptop computers and smartphones.
			
			The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, or even a person's body with the help of Kinect sensor. Players typically view the game on a video screen or television or computer monitor, or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets.
			
			In the 2010s, the commercial importance video game industry is of increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are driving the growth of the industry. As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.<!-- Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game--></p>

			<p>A review is an evaluation of a publication, service, or company such as a movie (a movie review), video game (video game review), musical composition (music review of a composition or recording), book (book review); a piece of hardware like a car, home appliance, or computer; or an event or performance, such as a live music concert, play, musical theater show, dance show, or art exhibition. In addition to a critical evaluation, the review's author may assign the work a rating to indicate its relative merit. More loosely, an author may review current events, trends, or items in the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called a review. The New York Review of Books, for instance, is a collection of essays on literature, culture, and current affairs. National Review, founded by William F. Buckley, Jr.,[1] is an influential conservative magazine, and Monthly Review is a long-running socialist periodical.</p>
			<p>So without further ado lets get into the reviews.</p>

				The post-apocalyptic world of Nier: Automata thrives on its mysteries. Its ruined Earth setting is a playground of mayhem where fashionable androids lay waste to less sophisticated looking robots. Its premise of a never-ending war is initially straightforward. But if you know anything about the game's director, Yoko Taro, then you know to expect the unexpected. That includes everything from an unusual soundtrack steeped in vocals to a battle-hardened heroine who walks with the swagger of a supermodel. Automata also delivers a well-executed and refined combat system, the level of which alone makes Automata well worth the price of admission.

				<p>
				You initially see Automata from the perspective of a female android named 2B who is part of YoRHa, a group of artificial soldiers tasked with wiping the Earth of its hostile robots and their alien creators. This conflict is all the more poignant due to humanity's displacement to the moon, an exodus that occurred hundreds of years ago. Joining 2B on most of her missions is 9S, a male android who lacks 2B's dual weapon-wielding prowess but compensates with invaluable hacking skills. They start off as strangers, but through the obstacles they overcome, an obvious closeness begins to form. This is thanks in part to Automata's sensational anime-as-hell archetypes and story beats.

				<p>
				Given that Earth is utterly overrun with homicidal machines, making Earth hospitable seems like a tall order. But this challenge is softened by the manageable size of Automata's open world, which is equivalent to a small city. It entices exploration without feeling intimidating, and it's hard to get lost once you've run through the same paths a couple times. Much of the backtracking stems from the game's numerable side quests, where you help your fellow androids on simple errands and kill missions. While most of these tasks aren't especially memorable, they do add character to world. Furthermore, monotony is minimized by the convenience of fast travel and swift steeds like moose and boars.

				The brightside of being a robot exterminator in Automata is that your canvas of destruction is the product of Platinum Games. Their penchant for feverishly fast and elegant combat is on full display with visuals that echo even the most outrageous attacks from Bayonetta. Combat evolves beyond mindlessly mashing on quick and strong attacks thanks to the variety of bladed weapon styles. Combining any two types produces uniquely flashy animations and, more importantly, damaging results. You can trigger other gorgeous maneuvers by attacking after pulling off a slick dodge cartwheel or by holding down either of the two attack buttons. 9S' own skill with a sword makes him a substantial AI-controlled contributor, and his ability to keep up with 2B make the battles look positively frenzied. Given the demanding yet rewarding high-dexterity combat and the acrobatic skills of 2B, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that Automata is the closest thing there is to a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, also developed by Platinum.

				From the moment Bayonetta's prologue begins, it's made abundantly clear that you're entering a world of pure wonder and spectacle. As the prelude unfolds, you control the titular heroine and stylishly dispatch an angelic host of enemies while standing on the face of an exploding clock tower as it tumbles end-over-end from a mountaintop. This brief and over-the-top sequence is but a first step on the long road of delightful insanity that will follow, with each and every moment pushing the limits of ridiculousness even further. But however ludicrous it may appear, do not make the mistake of dismissing Bayonetta as all style with no substance. Beneath its glossy facade lies an accessible but deep and intricately nuanced combat system that allows you to perform impressive feats and feel like part of the magically empowered. This high-octane hack-and-slash game is expertly paced and further enhanced by several subtle but brilliant tweaks to the formula. These include a powerful item concoction mode, a comprehensive scoring system with online leaderboards, and a loading screen cleverly disguised as a practice mode. Whether you believe in magic or not, Bayonetta is a truly bewitching experience.

				Five hundred years is long enough for an entire world to change, which is what the woman known as Bayonetta discovers after awakening from her slumber in a tomb at the bottom of a lake. With her memory understandably hazy, Bayonetta remembers little more than that she is an Umbran Witch and looking for something called The Eyes of the World. On a tip from her informant, she heads to the isolated city of Vigrid where she begins to piece together her missing memories and learn about the downfall of her clan and its counterparts: the Lumen Sages. What ensues is a series of hilariously over-the-top moments--each of which somehow surpasses the previous--that loosely form a narrative amidst a plethora of sight gags, sexual innuendos, and gratuitously violent angelic deaths. Amidst all the absurdity is a coherent plot with some surprisingly sweet moments, but the main attraction is the combat, not the storytelling.

				<p>
				Having contracted with the demons of Inferno, who serve as a source of her power, Bayonetta is a mortal enemy of the angels of Paradiso who seem to emerge at every corner in Vigrid spoiling for a fight. Armed from the get-go with a unique set of four guns (two of which are attached to her high heels), Bayonetta punches, kicks, and shoots her way through the heavenly aggressors that hound her every step. Apart from the basics, she can also perform a number of stylish special attacks to punish her enemies in often mind-boggling ways. Bullet climax attacks can strike out at all nearby attackers with most or all of Bayonetta's creatively wielded guns; wicked weave attacks summon monstrous, demonic appendages in her hair for a magical sucker punch or heel stomp; and torture attacks that conjure pain- and humiliation-inducing contraptions out of thin air. You're able to dish out an incredible amount of hurt in Bayonetta, and it's hard not to be hooked after experiencing the sheer pleasure of performing your first outrageous combo which may or may not involve break dancing, ensorcelled guillotines, and dozens of bullets to bridge together your myriad punches and kicks. As you fight through the angelic choirs, a variety of new weapons, such as a cursed katana or an enchanted pair of ice skates, are unlocked through trade with the demonic barkeep/smith Rodin, enhancing your already impressive arsenal even further. Because both Bayonetta's hands and feet are her weapons, you equip both with your instruments of heavenly destruction and can even have two entirely different sets ready for action with the tap of a button. These two arsenals can be swapped midcombo, which offers a great deal of flexibility (particularly when fighting several different types of angels at once) and makes battle feel free-form and pleasing. Truly, angels will cry before you're finished with them.

				<p>
				From the very beginning of the game, dozens of different combo attacks can be performed with the right recipe of button presses and timing, but even more advanced techniques are available for purchase from Rodin as well. In an ingenious move, the between-level loading screens also double as a practice mode of sorts where you can play around with each of Bayonetta's attacks. Complete with a handy onscreen move list, this feature is invaluable for learning the differences between the many different combos and finding the ones that work best for you, and you can even turn it into a full-fledged practice mode at the touch of a button. Even with this helpful mode, though, it can be tricky to grasp the subtle nuances of combat. If complex combos or elaborate attack dances aren't your thing, Bayonetta's easy and very easy difficulties equip everyone with the means for performing even the most impressive of attacks almost effortlessly. But for those clamoring for a challenge, Bayonetta does not disappoint--on normal difficulty, even lesser angels can prove to be fatal, and there are two harder levels to unlock for the most skillful of players to brave.

				Cuphead first appeared way back at E3 2014, where it wowed everyone with its gorgeous 1930s style cartoon aesthetic and promise of tough as nails platforming action. It finally came out last Friday and boy, does it deliver on that promise.

				Cuphead is like a bullet hell shooter where the bullets are more likely to be sentient balloon animals. The story is slight but delightful: after gambling away their souls, Cuphead (and Mugman, if you’re playing coop) take on the devil’s dirty work and set about collecting soul contracts across Inkwell Isle. Boss battles form the bulk of the game, with some occasional side scrolling platforming thrown in for variety. Those bosses are the star of the show however, beautifully brought to life by the unique hand-animated art style.

				I’ve faced a telekinetic carrot, a pair of boxing frogs that eat other to turn into a slot machine, and a unicycling plane lady who can transform into a bull shaped cloud, two dancing cloud women and the moon. I’ll avoid spoiling any more bosses, because discovering each one (and the different stages of each fight) is the main joy of Cuphead. Gaining mastery over the challenge is satisfying, sure, but that’s nothing new – you can get that from your Super Meat Boys and your N Plus Plusses. Each of Cuphead’s bosses has more personality than can be found in the entirety of those games though. It sounds great too, with an original jazz score that perfectly accompanies the old timey visuals.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Cuphead https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/02/cuphead-review/-->
				<p>
				It never runs out of ways to surprise, with the bosses getting even more inventive as the game goes on. It’s also made me chuckle out loud a few times, such as when I landed the final blow on a boss and the two birds that were carrying him on a stretcher swapped out their medicine pills for salt and pepper shakers. Every animation oozes charm, from the dancing hourglass that appears on loading screens to the way Cuphead pulls up his trousers at the start of each fight.

				<p>
				If you want to actually see those bosses though, you’re going to have to Git Gud. Each level can be played on ‘simple’ or ‘regular’ difficulty, but you only get to fight the last bosses once you’ve beaten the rest on regular. Simple mode slashes the bosses health pools and takes away entire stages from the fight, which it would be a shame to miss out on. It’s still a great inclusion as a sort of ‘tourist’ mode, however, and will allow a lot of people to appreciate a game they otherwise wouldn’t, while still rewarding those who persevere on regular difficulty.

				Fran Bow made me smile more than any other game I’ve played this year. That might come as a surprise if all you’ve seen of the game is a couple of screenshots feauring gore and dead kids. Fran Bow opens with a gory murder scene and then traps its young protagonist in a creepy institution for (criminally?) insane children. But that initial setting and the dark tone are just a small slice of a story that spans worlds and perfectly captures the beautiful, delightful nonsense of Alice’s Adventures, an inspiration that is imprinted on the game.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Fran Bow https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/04/fran-bow-review/-->
				<p>
				The art style won me over immediately. Not just imaginative but beautifully detailed, the early scenes are claustrophobic, dingy and dripping with gore. It’s more like 1980s oddity Weird Dreams than anything in the retro adventure revival. Perspectives are foreshortened and confused so that even mundane objects seem weird, and that’s before Fran swallows one of the pills from her infinite supply, allowing her to see the machinery of the world. That machinery is in the form of exposed muscle, bone and organs, as well as ethereal entities that may be spirit vampires or perhaps representations of emotional and mental collapse.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Fran Bow https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/04/fran-bow-review/-->
				<p>
				I had doubts about the game’s treatment of mental illness and chemical treatment as a gateway to insight and terrible wonders, but a couple of hours into the game they were laid to bed. Fran Bow is about grief, and learning to process feelings and events. As the story develops, it swiftly moves away from the use of illness as a vehicle for shocks and scares, although if you only played the demo you might think that’s the game’s entire raison d’etre.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Fran Bow https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/04/fran-bow-review/-->
				<p>
				That opening is essential. As Fran develops, her ability to confront horrors with a sense of polite wonder rather than fleeing from them comes to define her. She is able to face down nightmarish creatures in the same way that Alice dismisses The Red Queen through the Looking Glass. Fran’s ‘enemy’ isn’t her own mind – it is death, and specifically the death of her parents, and it is death that she considers to be “the cause of all the mischief”.

				Ashes of Arandiel is the first of two DLCs for Dark Souls III, making it quite possibly the penultimate Souls adventure. We sent intrepid Robert Zak into the cold wastes of the Painted World of Ariandel to see how well it lives up to the mighty legacy of the series, and he returned a short time later stricken with frostbite. And wolfbites. Here’s wot he thinks.

				<p>
				“I really should’ve learned how to parry”, springs to my mind as I fall for the ninth time to a scythe-wielding lady, and the familiar “You Died” message fades into view along with that dreadful chime that sounds like a Chinese gong reverberating through some Stygian cavern. The thing about these Soulsborne DLCs is that they assume mastery on your part – not only in the sense that you’ve completed the main game, but that you’ve been playing it persistently for the seven months since its release and have it all hard-coded into your muscle memory. They brutally exploit weaknesses in your game, and the fact that I tried using the face buttons instead of the right shoulder buttons to attack when I first loaded up Ashes of Ariandel tells you all you need to know about my so-called ‘muscle memory’.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Dark Souls III https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/28/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-pc-review/-->
				<p>
				Not that I’m complaining. A difficulty spike – coated in the bloodstains of hapless Souls-rusty players like myself – is par for the course, and on that front Ashes of Ariandel delivers. It dutifully deceives you at every opportunity, and bluffs and double-bluffs to keep you in a state of twitchy Souls paranoia as you traverse the hostile, blizzard-blasted Painted World. It’s formidable, beautiful, and toe-curlingly tense, because it’s Dark Souls and of course it is; it’d take an unprecedented cock-up for From Software at this late stage to not deliver on those fronts.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Dark Souls III https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/28/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-pc-review/-->
				<p>
				And yet, more than ever, this DLC seems to be going through the motions – ticking the boxes of atmosphere and challenge, while offering a story that doesn’t patch up any of the narrative holes in the main game, nor delivering much in the way of originality or rewarding level design. At around 3-4 hours long, it’s by far the shortest of Souls DLCs, which – fittingly given its setting – may leave Season Pass owners feeling a little cold.
				</p>
				<!--taken from rockpapershotguns review of Dark Souls III https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/28/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-pc-review/-->
				<p>
				Finding the Ashes of Ariandel is less cryptic than getting into previous Souls DLCs (or exactly the same if, like me, you Google it instead of running around the entire world trying to join together tenuously connected oddities like you were Guybrush Threepwood circa. 1994). Just zap yourself over to the Cleansing Chapel bonfire, and an old hollow will tell you about a prophecy of how two Ashen Ones will set alight the forlorn Painted World of Ariandel (which exists in the same strange dimension as the Painted World of Ariamis from the original Dark Souls), before sucking you into a scrap of paper and having a right old chuckle about it.

				Cuphead first appeared way back at E3 2014, where it wowed everyone with its gorgeous 1930s style cartoon aesthetic and promise of tough as nails platforming action. It finally came out last Friday and boy, does it deliver on that promise.

				Cuphead is like a bullet hell shooter where the bullets are more likely to be sentient balloon animals. The story is slight but delightful: after gambling away their souls, Cuphead (and Mugman, if you’re playing coop) take on the devil’s dirty work and set about collecting soul contracts across Inkwell Isle. Boss battles form the bulk of the game, with some occasional side scrolling platforming thrown in for variety. Those bosses are the star of the show however, beautifully brought to life by the unique hand-animated art style.

				I’ve faced a telekinetic carrot, a pair of boxing frogs that eat other to turn into a slot machine, and a unicycling plane lady who can transform into a bull shaped cloud, two dancing cloud women and the moon. I’ll avoid spoiling any more bosses, because discovering each one (and the different stages of each fight) is the main joy of Cuphead. Gaining mastery over the challenge is satisfying, sure, but that’s nothing new – you can get that from your Super Meat Boys and your N Plus Plusses. Each of Cuphead’s bosses has more personality than can be found in the entirety of those games though. It sounds great too, with an original jazz score that perfectly accompanies the old timey visuals.

				<p>
				It never runs out of ways to surprise, with the bosses getting even more inventive as the game goes on. It’s also made me chuckle out loud a few times, such as when I landed the final blow on a boss and the two birds that were carrying him on a stretcher swapped out their medicine pills for salt and pepper shakers. Every animation oozes charm, from the dancing hourglass that appears on loading screens to the way Cuphead pulls up his trousers at the start of each fight.

				<p>
				If you want to actually see those bosses though, you’re going to have to Git Gud. Each level can be played on ‘simple’ or ‘regular’ difficulty, but you only get to fight the last bosses once you’ve beaten the rest on regular. Simple mode slashes the bosses health pools and takes away entire stages from the fight, which it would be a shame to miss out on. It’s still a great inclusion as a sort of ‘tourist’ mode, however, and will allow a lot of people to appreciate a game they otherwise wouldn’t, while still rewarding those who persevere on regular difficulty.

				Cuphead is like a bullet hell shooter where the bullets are more likely to be sentient balloon animals. The story is slight but delightful: after gambling away their souls, Cuphead (and Mugman, if you’re playing coop) take on the devil’s dirty work and set about collecting soul contracts across Inkwell Isle. Boss battles form the bulk of the game, with some occasional side scrolling platforming thrown in for variety. Those bosses are the star of the show however, beautifully brought to life by the unique hand-animated art style.

				I’ve faced a telekinetic carrot, a pair of boxing frogs that eat other to turn into a slot machine, and a unicycling plane lady who can transform into a bull shaped cloud, two dancing cloud women and the moon. I’ll avoid spoiling any more bosses, because discovering each one (and the different stages of each fight) is the main joy of Cuphead. Gaining mastery over the challenge is satisfying, sure, but that’s nothing new – you can get that from your Super Meat Boys and your N Plus Plusses. Each of Cuphead’s bosses has more personality than can be found in the entirety of those games though. It sounds great too, with an original jazz score that perfectly accompanies the old timey visuals.

				<p>
				It never runs out of ways to surprise, with the bosses getting even more inventive as the game goes on. It’s also made me chuckle out loud a few times, such as when I landed the final blow on a boss and the two birds that were carrying him on a stretcher swapped out their medicine pills for salt and pepper shakers. Every animation oozes charm, from the dancing hourglass that appears on loading screens to the way Cuphead pulls up his trousers at the start of each fight.

				If you want to actually see those bosses though, you’re going to have to Git Gud. Each level can be played on ‘simple’ or ‘regular’ difficulty, but you only get to fight the last bosses once you’ve beaten the rest on regular. Simple mode slashes the bosses health pools and takes away entire stages from the fight, which it would be a shame to miss out on. It’s still a great inclusion as a sort of ‘tourist’ mode, however, and will allow a lot of people to appreciate a game they otherwise wouldn’t, while still rewarding those who persevere on regular difficulty.

				I have this love hate relationship with Celeste that makes me keep coming back for more. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a massive fan of 2D Platforming Games, especially dificult ones similar to that of Super Meat Boy.
				Celeste is no different with challenging jump puzzles and difficult platforming bits, at least in my eyes. My love for this game though comes not from its platforming challenges, which many might pick the game up for and might find love in, but from its story and the way it handles that of mental health.
				Now I don't claim to hold experience in every type of mental health condition handled. Thankfully. However, I can appreciate how those that I have had experience with are handled as well as the ways it enables me to experience the others in a new light. 
				The main character Madeline decides to push herself to climb a mountain. A simple goal akin to something all of us have had in our lives at some point or another. Madeline deals with issues of low self worth, anxiety and depression.
				These are both often shown through Madeline herself but also through Badeline, a dark embodiment of Madelines negative thoughts. The conversations between the two akin to that of self infliciting bad thoughts. The games take on these mental health problems and the challenge they can make in overcoming a goal or obstacle is really quite amazing.
